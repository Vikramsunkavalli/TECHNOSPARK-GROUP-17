# TECHNOSPARK-GROUP-17
Fake + Real News Website Challenge
Objective:
Create a single-page website titled “TechnoSpark Newsroom” featuring a mix of real and 
fake news articles. The goal is to make it challenging for others to guess which stories are true 
and which are made up.
Note: Do not include anything about IIM Sambalpur in the content. Use completely fictional or 
generic themes instead.
Guidelines:
• You are a team of 10 members
• Divide tasks among yourselves according to your expertise
• Website must include 5 to 8 news articles and you may include images or videos to 
make it more engaging
Deliverable:
• A fully functional single-page website
• Submit the URL via the official submission link
Tips:
• You’re free to use any theme — tech, entertainment, lifestyle, politics, science etc
• Make the fake news realistic and the real news surprising to keep others guessing
